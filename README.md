# Glicious-backend

Flask app to fetch dining menus everyday and create api to display opening time and menus for Glicious application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo.

Next, Install [Flask]:

```
$ pip3 install Flask
```

Next, Go to flask folder:

```
$ cd flask
```

Finally, Run python.py:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=python
$ flask run

The api should be available at <http://localhost:5000/api/v1/menus/all>.

## Technical Skill Showcase

This api is built using Flask. 
Things that showcase my development skills include reformatting JSON file using Python to add time schedule, 
fetching api from college Dining Menu website, and creating crontab to fetch data and update api everyday.
